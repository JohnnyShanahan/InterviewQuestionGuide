# Convert Binary Tree to its Mirror
Description: 
Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to invert the tree.

## The Problem: 
You may ask yourself when and how would inverting a binary tree be useful. As a newbie I asked myself that same question. The answer is, it is useful in showing how you breakdown a problem and how well you understand data structures. If you are like me and like to see practical examples to help you learn, well you are out of luck. A quick google search "practical applications of mirroring binary trees‚Äù just returned the controversy of this question being asked in interviews. Take a look at the links below for a fun read of the perception of this particular problem.

### The good news: 
The process of Mirroring a binary tree is pretty straight forward to understand.

## Problem Description: Invert a binary Tree
An inverted binary tree also called the mirror of an input tree is another binary tree with left and right childern are swaped resulting in a mirror image of the input tree.
